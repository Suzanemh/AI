This repository is dedicated to managing, cleaning, and analyzing a dataset ('stud.csv') consisting of student data.
The dataset includes the following columns: StudentID, Age, email, hrsStudy, and FinalGrade.
This effort is part of a project for the course 'Introduction to AI' at OsloMet, where the primary goal is to preprocess this data,
identify and handle outliers and missing values, and perform exploratory data analysis.
